It is a simple framework for applications Web.
we are a small development company that believes in the power full of open source.
This framework is the core that can be used for creating web application in a simple way. For creating applications it is necessary the other part (we call webapp level). You can find an example into code-google (yhaguy-project and vidrioluz).
If you are interested in collaborating or using this framework, and don't know how, please contact me.

Best regards
Daniel Romero
